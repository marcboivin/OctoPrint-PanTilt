# OctoPrint-PanTilt

Allows you to hook your camera to Ã  tilt/pan control and control it from OctoPi's web interface

Still a work in progress!

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/marcboivin/OctoPrint-PanTilt/archive/master.zip

**TODO:** Describe how to install your plugin, if more needs to be done than just installing it via pip or through
the plugin manager.

The camera needs to be hooked up to pin 12 and 11 of the RPi.

Idea is from this guy http://www.toptechboy.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-lesson-28-controlling-a-servo-on-raspberry-pi-with-python/

## Configuration

**TODO:** Describe your plugin's configuration options (if any).
